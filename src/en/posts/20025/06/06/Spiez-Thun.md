# From Spiez to Thun, on Foot

Today is a wonderful day - it's Friday. (Friday is always wonderful simply because it's Friday.) We, of course, decided to spend this Friday in a very special way - we're going to Spiez. (Spiez is a small town very close to our Thun.) It, Spiez, is somehow small and cozy, and there's also a restaurant where you can eat very deliciously.

I really liked this staircase, it's so, so, so incredibly long... The idea to count the steps, of course, occurred to me only after I had already climbed up.
